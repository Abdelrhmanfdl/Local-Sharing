# ðŸ“¡ Local Files Distributor

> Simple, but useful

## The problem it solves...

Sometimes, we need to quickly share files from a single computer to one or many other devices. But, unfortunately there is no flash drive or a USB to connect the mobile phone.

This simple app can easily help you to share these files within your local network.

## How it works?

1- Install Node.js

2- Install dependencies of this app (_npm install_)

3- Run the app inside folder "backend" (_node server_)

4- Place the files you want to share inside the folder: **Make_Files_Public**

6- You will find download links for all files in **Make_Files_Public**
